# # Project 2: Breakout Strategy
# ## Instructions
# Each problem consists of a function to implement and instructions on how to implement the function.  The parts of the function that need to be implemented are marked with a `# TODO` comment. After implementing the function, run the cell to test it against the unit tests we've provided. For each problem, we provide one or more unit tests from our `project_tests` package. These unit tests won't tell you if your answer is correct, but will warn you of any major errors. Your code will be checked for the correct solution when you submit it to Udacity.
# 
# ## Packages
# When you implement the functions, you'll only need to you use the packages you've used in the classroom, like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). These packages will be imported for you. We recommend you don't add any import statements, otherwise the grader might not be able to run your code.
# 
# The other packages that we're importing are `helper`, `project_helper`, and `project_tests`. These are custom packages built to help you solve the problems.  The `helper` and `project_helper` module contains utility functions and graph functions. The `project_tests` contains the unit tests for all the problems.
# 
# ### Install Packages

# In[ ]:


import sys
get_ipython().system('{sys.executable} -m pip install -r requirements.txt')


# ### Load Packages

import project_tests


# ## Market Data
# ### Load Data
# While using real data will give you hands on experience, it's doesn't cover all the topics we try to condense in one project. We'll solve this by creating new stocks. We've create a scenario where companies mining [Terbium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terbium) are making huge profits. All the companies in this sector of the market are made up. They represent a sector with large growth that will be used for demonstration latter in this project.

# In[7]:


df_original = pd.read_csv('../../data/project_2/eod-quotemedia.csv', parse_dates=['date'], index_col=False)

# Add TB sector to the market
df = df_original
df = pd.concat([df] + project_helper.generate_tb_sector(df[df['ticker'] == 'AAPL']['date']), ignore_index=True)

close = df.reset_index().pivot(index='date', columns='ticker', values='adj_close')
high = df.reset_index().pivot(index='date', columns='ticker', values='adj_high')
low = df.reset_index().pivot(index='date', columns='ticker', values='adj_low')

# ### Stock Example
# Let's see what a single stock looks like from the closing prices. For this example and future display examples in this project, we'll use Apple's stock (AAPL). If we tried to graph all the stocks, it would be too much information.

# ## The Alpha Research Process
# 
# In this project you will code and evaluate a "breakout" signal. It is important to understand where these steps fit in the alpha research workflow. The signal-to-noise ratio in trading signals is very low and, as such, it is very easy to fall into the trap of _overfitting_ to noise. It is therefore inadvisable to jump right into signal coding. To help mitigate overfitting, it is best to start with a general observation and hypothesis; i.e., you should be able to answer the following question _before_ you touch any data:
# 
# > What feature of markets or investor behaviour would lead to a persistent anomaly that my signal will try to use?
# 
# Ideally the assumptions behind the hypothesis will be testable _before_ you actually code and evaluate the signal itself. The workflow therefore is as follows:
# 
# ![image](images/alpha_steps.png)
# 
# In this project, we assume that the first three steps area done ("observe & research", "form hypothesis", "validate hypothesis"). The hypothesis you'll be using for this project is the following:
# - In the absence of news or significant investor trading interest, stocks oscillate in a range.
# - Traders seek to capitalize on this range-bound behaviour periodically by selling/shorting at the top of the range and buying/covering at the bottom of the range. This behaviour reinforces the existence of the range.
# - When stocks break out of the range, due to, e.g., a significant news release or from market pressure from a large investor:
#     - the liquidity traders who have been providing liquidity at the bounds of the range seek to cover their positions to mitigate losses, thus magnifying the move out of the range, _and_
#     - the move out of the range attracts other investor interest; these investors, due to the behavioural bias of _herding_ (e.g., [Herd Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/university/behavioral_finance/behavioral8.asp)) build positions which favor continuation of the trend.
# 
# 
# Using this hypothesis, let start coding..
# ## Compute the Highs and Lows in a Window
# You'll use the price highs and lows as an indicator for the breakout strategy. In this section, implement `get_high_lows_lookback` to get the maximum high price and minimum low price over a window of days. The variable `lookback_days` contains the number of days to look in the past. Make sure this doesn't include the current day.

# | -1 | Low > Close Price |
# | 1  | High < Close Price |
# | 0  | Otherwise |

# ## Filter Signals
# That was a lot of repeated signals! If we're already shorting a stock, having an additional signal to short a stock isn't helpful for this strategy. This also applies to additional long signals when the last signal was long.
# 
# Implement `filter_signals` to filter out repeated long or short signals within the `lookahead_days`. If the previous signal was the same, change the signal to `0` (do nothing signal). For example, say you have a single stock time series that is
# 
# `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, -1, -1]`
# 
# Running `filter_signals` with a lookahead of 3 days should turn those signals into
# 
# `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0]`
# 
# To help you implement the function, we have provided you with the `clear_signals` function. This will remove all signals within a window after the last signal. For example, say you're using a windows size of 3 with `clear_signals`. It would turn the Series of long signals
# 
# `[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]`
# 
# into
# 
# `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`
# 
# `clear_signals` only takes a Series of the same type of signals, where `1` is the signal and `0` is no signal. It can't take a mix of long and short signals. Using this function, implement `filter_signals`. 
# 
# For implementing `filter_signals`, we don't reccommend you try to find a vectorized solution. Instead, you should use the [`iterrows`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/generated/pandas.DataFrame.iterrows.html) over each column.

# The histograms, which describes the distributions of the return in different windows of lookahead period, shows the mean, standard deviation and maximum returns of the distribution. Above graphs show distributions centered around mean with zero while standard deviation(volatility) increasing with additional lookahead days that may be due to outliers in our analysis.  

# ## Outliers

# Let's compare the 5, 10, and 20 day signals returns without outliers to normal distributions. Also, let's see how the P-Value has changed with the outliers removed.
